# ⚡ Universal Image Downloader (Atsu, Mangadot, MangaGo)

A high-performance, unified Tampermonkey userscript designed to scrape, convert, and natively package manga and comic chapters into ZIP files directly within your browser. 

Currently supported platforms: **Atsumaru (atsu.moe)**, **Mangadot (mangadot.net)**, and **MangaGo (mangago.me / mangago.zone)**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🚀 10x Concurrent Downloading:** Multi-threaded worker system dramatically accelerates image fetching, utilizing up to 10 simultaneous connections to max out your download speed.
* **📦 Native Client-Side ZIP Generation:** Bypasses the need for external servers or CORS workarounds by generating CSP-safe `.zip` files entirely within the browser's memory using `ArrayBuffer` and native Blob APIs.
* **🖼️ AVIF to High-Quality JPG Conversion:** Automatically intercepts `.avif` and transparent images (crucial for Atsu.moe), rendering them onto a canvas with a solid white background and converting to optimized JPG.
* **🧭 SPA (Single Page Application) Tracking:** Dynamically hooks into `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to intercept JSON payloads. It updates the download cache on the fly when you change chapters.
* **🎨 Seamless Native UI Integration:** Injects custom download buttons equipped with dynamic SVG icons and percentage trackers that perfectly match the native styling and layout grids of each respective site.
* **🛡️ Isolated Execution:** Code for each supported site runs in entirely separate function scopes based on the active hostname, guaranteeing zero variable contamination or cross-site layout breakage.
* **📱 Mobile Compatible:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices via Tampermonkey (only chromium browsers) or other script managers (e.g., Violentmonkey, Greasemonkey).
